# About me, Life before moving: 
+ Volgograd region, the city of Volzhsky. He was a life partner, at the age of 12 (2002) he first got into a gaming computer club, this fascinated him with a new fantasy and vibrant world. becoming a regular school truant, I met system administrators and learned computer basics, a year later I was hired as a "junior system administrator" I worked there for 6 years and left.

# After moving: 
+ I divide my life into two short stages for the reason that a person is shaped by the environment. as Darwin would say, **the species that can most effectively adapt to the environment survives.** So I moved to the city of Moscow at the age of 24.

+ Worked as a field service engineer for repair and maintenance of computer equipment. I have professional knowledge in the field of setting up operating systems, networks and setting up programs, I have learned basic repair of computer and mobile devices.

+ I opened his own service center for the repair of equipment, recruited employees and tried to develop the business. The difficulties of the market and the lack of money for life forced me to reconsider my plans for life, now I would like to master Frontend development, ***I ask you to help me with this and give me the opportunity to personally thank you and the community for the opportunity to do this for free. with a huge amount of open information***

# Education:
+ 2007, graduated from a technical college as an electrician for the repair and maintenance of complex equipment. When there is no money, there is no choice where to study. I didn't want to join the army at 18.

# English
+ Since I skipped school to work in a computer club, my English level is about A1, but years spent at the computer and hard work this year should improve my skills to B1-B2.
